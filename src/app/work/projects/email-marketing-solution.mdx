## Challenges and Learnings

Being allowed to modify HTML using HTML was a meta-challenge that was complex, but a fun challenge. How to format the completed email to not only work in different email clients, but also only use HTML that is allowed with the email protocol, was also a difficult challenge. One we ultimately managed to solve.
