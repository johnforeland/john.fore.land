        I&apos;m as full-stack as you can get, but I&apos;m the most passionate
        for front-end (clearly). However, don&apos;t underestimate my skills in
        backend, integration, DevOps and architecture in general!
        <br />
        <br />
        You&apos;ll always find me building solutions with the end user in mind,
        whether that be customers, employees or other developers. With a
        background in software engineering and a passion for design, I&apos;m
        always looking for ways to improve the user experience (and add a bit of
        flare to it).
